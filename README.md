#Stroke Severity Prediction Project

Predict stroke severity using machine learning models built with Python and visualized using Gradio.

---

##Project Contents

- `stroke_sevrity.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook (Colab-based) for data analysis and model building.
- `app.py` → Gradio web app to interactively test the stroke severity prediction model.

---

##Try the App Online

> Coming Soon on [Gradio Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces) or [Streamlit Cloud](https://share.streamlit.io/) *(deployment optional)*

---

##  Features

-  Data preprocessing & cleaning  
- EDA with visualizations  
-  Machine learning model to predict stroke severity  
- Gradio UI for real-time prediction
